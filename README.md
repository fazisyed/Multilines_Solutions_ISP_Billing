## 🧩 Usage Tips

*   **Column Visibility**: If your table looks cluttered, click the **"Columns"** button (top-right of tables) to uncheck fields you don't need. The system remembers your choice!
*   **Printing**: All pages have a "Print" button that is optimized to save ink and paper, hiding navigation bars and buttons.
*   **Importing**: When importing Excel files, ensure your first row contains headers. The system will help you match them.
